            I&apos;m hoping this site can capture how Poly is handling COVID and a bit of what
            student life is like, in some sort of archive-y way. The data portion of this site
            was hacked together pretty quickly, meaning there&apos;s plenty of room for improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also a few different directions this could go. I&apos;ll list some of my
            thoughts below. If you&apos;re reading this (wow) and have ideas or want to help out,
            feel free to

            side note: I realize this was made quite late in the long game of covid. Stress checking
            the dashboard at the start of Omicron made me want a better dashboard, so here we are.
